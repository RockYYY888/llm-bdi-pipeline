### 2. SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW.md (108 lines)
- Test results across different implementation versions
- Root cause analysis of bugs
- Development history

### 3. STRESS_TEST_REPORT.md (209 lines)
- Formal completeness and soundness guarantees
- Performance characteristics
- Production-readiness validation

### 4. DOT_STRING_EXAMPLES.md (314 lines)
- Before/after DOT string examples
- Visual decision tree representations
- Code generation implications

### 5. IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md (580 lines)
- Detailed technical analysis

- Equivalence checking methodology
- Potential issues and improvements

### 6. IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md (older review)
- Early implementation status review
- Issues and improvements identified

## Why Archived?

These files were created during development for detailed technical documentation. They have been consolidated into README.md to provide a single source of truth for the DFA conversion design, making it easier for developers to find and understand the key design decisions.

## Access Archived Content

To view the original detailed documents, check the files in this directory. However, the README.md now contains all essential information in a more organized format.
