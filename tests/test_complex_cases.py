Complex Test Cases for LTL-BDI Pipeline

Tests based on FOND benchmark problems (bw_5_1, bw_5_3, bw_5_5):
- Complex rearrangement tasks with 5 blocks
- Non-trivial initial states (pre-built towers)
- Multiple goals requiring sophisticated planning

Note: Only tests LLM AgentSpeak generation (Branch A).
FOND planning (Branch B) has been moved to legacy/fond/
