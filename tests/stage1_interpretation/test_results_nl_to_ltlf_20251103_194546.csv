14,negative_constraint,Never put a on b,"G(not(on(a, b)))","['a', 'b']",G(not(on)),"['a', 'b']",False,wrong,,"Formula completely mismatched | Expected: G(not(on(a, b))) | Got: G(not(on))",Negative constraint,G with negation
15,multi_block_clear,Ensure blocks a b and c are all clear,"F(clear(a)), F(clear(b)), F(clear(c))","['a', 'b', 'c']","F(clear(a)), F(clear(b)), F(clear(c))","['a', 'b', 'c']",True,exact,,✓ Perfect match,Multiple clear goals,Multiple F operators
