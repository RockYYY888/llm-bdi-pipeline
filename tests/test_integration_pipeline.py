Integration Tests for LTL-BDI Pipeline (End-to-End)

Tests the complete pipeline flow: NL -> LTLf -> DFA -> AgentSpeak
Based on FOND benchmark problems (bw_5_1, bw_5_3, bw_5_5):
- Complex rearrangement tasks with 5 blocks
- Multiple goals requiring sophisticated planning
- Validates all pipeline stages working together

Mode: dfa_agentspeak (NL -> LTLf -> DFA -> AgentSpeak)
Note: FOND planning (Branch B) has been moved to legacy/fond/
